As Terence says in his book, students should write down every step of each excercise instead of ``cheating''. Taking his advice, here comes the book. However, it's too time consuming to write down every single step with \LaTeX. Considering this, I will only type critical steps and significant tricks towards excercises that worth my time.\\The book is written as a notebook for myself which means there may exists many oral expressions or feelins of myself. If , oneday, the book is read by some of my friends, please ignore those personal words. Also, I writing this book to learn how to write rigorously without many grammer mistakes. If you use this book as a reference and encouter some of unclearly expressions or typos during reading, please contact Xinhao Yang at the first time.
